            <b>Experts advise diabetics to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each day because sleep loss causes glucose levels to increase.
            </b><br>Sleep plays a critical role in controlling a variety of metabolic-related physiological processes. As a result, there is strong evidence to support the link between sleep patterns and the risk of diabetes. The risk of diabetes has specifically been linked to inadequate sleep duration and/or sleep restriction in the lab, poor sleep quality, and sleep disorders such insomnia and sleep apnea.

            A significant unsolved public health issue is inadequate sleep duration, according to a study published in PMC. Overwhelming evidence suggests that reduced sleep length, such as 5 h per day (very short sleep) and 6 h per day (short sleep), is more detrimental to health than other traditional diabetes risk factors such being overweight, having a family history of the disease, and being inactive.
