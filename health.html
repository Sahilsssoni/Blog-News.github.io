                <b>5 tips to keep your gut healthy this monsoon</b><br>1. Switch to plant-based drinks – Plant-based drinks such as soy and almonds have gained popularity as lactose-free substitutes. They are rich in vitamins and minerals, low in cholesterol, and have a healthy combination of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Hot beverages made from plant-based drinks are easy to digest and help to keep the body hydrated, especially in monsoons.
               <br> 2. Include immunity boosters – Turmeric, black pepper, garlic, and ginger are the immune-boosting ingredients that should be added to fluids or foods during meal preparations. They are known to have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antioxidant properties. Turmeric Latte can be consumed during monsoons owing to its immunity boosting properties. If animal milk causes inflammation, you can also pick a plant-based drink.

 <br>3. Consume seasonal foods – Seasonal foods must be consumed during monsoons to maintain a healthy gut. Consume Vitamin C-rich fruits such as apple, beetroot, pear, jamun, plums, cherries, pomegranates and litchis. Smoothies with plant-based drinks are a great idea to consume seasonal fruits while ensuring your protein requirements are met. It’s also a great option for vegans.

<br>4. Avoid food items that are heavy to digest – Non-vegetable foods, seafood and oily foods take time to digest and impact your gut. Milk can also be difficult to digest for people suffering from lactose intolerance. In that case, you can switch to plant-based drinks to replace milk in milkshakes, pasta sauces, and regular tea or coffee.
<br>5. Have a combination of raw and cooked foods – As nutritionists, we recommend eating a healthy plate- 50% of your plate should contain vegetable groups. During monsoons, we need to have a combination of raw and cooked foods. If you consume only raw vegetables, there are changes that overstimulate the digestive system leading to flatulence. Beans and legumes could also get heavy at times so it is recommended to consume more dals especially moong or lentils which are easier to digest. If you cannot tolerate the legume group at all, going for plant-based drinks as a source of protein is the best option. As a substitute to raw salads, choosing homemade hot soups is also a great choice. Alternatively, freshly cooked vegetables like bitter gourd can be eaten to strengthen the digestive system.

            <p class="active"><b>Monkeypox: experts give virus variants new names</b><br>A group of global experts convened by WHO has agreed on new names for monkeypox virus variants, as part of ongoing efforts to align the names of the monkeypox disease, virus and variants—or clades—with current best practices. The experts agreed to name the clades using Roman numerals.

                The monkeypox virus was named upon first discovery in 1958, before current best practices in naming diseases and viruses were adopted. Similarly for the name of the disease it causes. Major variants were identified by the geographic regions where they were known to circulate.
                
                Current best practise is that newly-identified viruses, related disease, and virus variants should be given names with the aim to avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic groups, and minimize any negative impact on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare.</p>

Common cold and flu, fever, viral infections etc. are most prone to this season. This is the time when battling seasonal diseases weakens the immune system and increases your risk of falling ill.

            <p class="active"><b>Why India doesn’t need to worry about polio case in NY</b><br>The US eradicated polio in 1955 following a massive immunisation drive with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). However, fears have mounted again after the New York State Department of Health alerted community members a few weeks ago that a person in Rockland County had tested positive for polio. On August 12, health officials also reported poliovirus samples in New York City’s wastewater samples.

                Following the discovery of the poliovirus in two areas of London before this case, there are many questions regarding the resurgence of polio and if India should be worried?
                
                So, what should India do? “India is already doing a good job with polio management and vaccination. Our door-to-door and micro-level interventions are an example of the collective will of our people and Government, very well acknowledged by the WHO. Besides, our environmental surveillance is top notch. And that’s what we need to keep doing. As part of our routine community drills and sampling, we too detected some polio strains in sewage samples around Mumbai last year. Sewage is a very good indicator because it is a receptacle of all that is coming out of the human body. But nobody fell ill. We do get a few odd examples every year but there’s immediate follow-up and vigilance,” says virologist and public health microbiologist, Prof Gagandeep Kang.</p>

            <p class="active"><b>Experts advise diabetics to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each day because sleep loss causes glucose levels to increase.
            </b><br>Sleep plays a critical role in controlling a variety of metabolic-related physiological processes. As a result, there is strong evidence to support the link between sleep patterns and the risk of diabetes. The risk of diabetes has specifically been linked to inadequate sleep duration and/or sleep restriction in the lab, poor sleep quality, and sleep disorders such insomnia and sleep apnea.

            A significant unsolved public health issue is inadequate sleep duration, according to a study published in PMC. Overwhelming evidence suggests that reduced sleep length, such as 5 h per day (very short sleep) and 6 h per day (short sleep), is more detrimental to health than other traditional diabetes risk factors such being overweight, having a family history of the disease, and being inactive.

            <p class="active"><b>Some Exciting News Regarding The Newest Covid Variants
            </b><br>The incubation time, which is greater than that of the majority of viral infections, is the worst of Covid-19's most harmful characteristics. It can be more difficult to control a virus the longer it takes for it to replicate within a person before symptoms appear. This is because to the increased risk that those who are afflicted would unintentionally distribute it widely.

            The good news is that it seems like there is less time passing between exposure and the onset of symptoms.
            
            Scientists from Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing conducted experiments and research to estimate the incubation period of Covid induced by the various strains of SARS-CoV-2 by analysing data from more than 140 investigations. According to the findings, the average decreased from 5 days with the alpha version to 3.42 days with the omicron.
