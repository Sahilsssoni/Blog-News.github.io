            <b>India plans new ‘right to repair’ rule for gadgets</b><br>According to a statement from the ministry of consumer affairs on Thursday, gadget manufacturers may soon have to mandatorily offer repair services for their products, from mobile phones to laptops, as a consumer right.
            Gadget manufacturers may soon have to mandatorily offer repair services for their products, from mobile phones to laptops, as a consumer right. The ministry of consumer affairs has set up a committee to come up with a comprehensive framework on a “right to repair”.
            The step could alter the landscape for tech maintenance, cutting costs for conked-out devices. Unlike car makers, mobile-phone companies often don’t provide original repair options, forcing consumers to entirely replace malfunctioning parts or make a new purchase. This could change.

            “Farming equipment, mobile phones/ tablets, consumer durables and automobiles/automobile equipment among sectors have been identified for the right to repair by the committee,” the ministry said in its statement.
            
            Consumer studies, such as a 2017 survey by Mostafa Sabbaghi of the University at Buffalo, have shown that when tech products falter, most consumers replace them with newer ones because fixing faulty devices reliably is difficult. Often, manufacturers don’t reveal full servicing information.
            
            In the US, for instance, President Joe Biden in 2021 had issued an executive order that “included a directive for limits on how tech manufacturers could restrict repairs”, according to a New York Times report.</p>
