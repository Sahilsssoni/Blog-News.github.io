            <b>A new AI-powered x-ray technique for detecting explosives could identify cancer</b><br>
            Researchers at University College London (UCL) in the UK have created a novel x-ray technique for detecting explosives that might also be used to identify tumors.

           The potentially early-stage fatal tumors in humans could be noticed by the new x-ray method that collaborates with a deep-learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect explosives in luggages, according to a report published by MIT Technology Review on Friday.

            "The AI is exceptionally good at picking up these materials even when they're hidden inside other objects," said Sandro Olivo, study lead author from the UCL's Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering.
            "Even if we hide a small quantity of explosive somewhere because there will be a little bit of texture in the middle of many other things, the algorithm will find it."

            The technique could be used in medical applications, particularly cancer screening, according to the research team.
            
            Although the researchers have not yet tested whether the technique can successfully distinguish the texture of a tumor from surrounding healthy breast tissue, they are excited about the possibility of detecting very small tumors that would have previously gone undetected behind a patient's rib cage.
            
            "I'd love to do it one day," said Olivo. "If we get a similar hit rate in detecting texture in tumors, the potential for early diagnosis is huge."
