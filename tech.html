            <p class="active"><b>Afraid to buy refurbished gadgets? Here's why you may be wrong</b><br>Global supply networks have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic's attack, driving up the cost of new goods. Indian consumers are increasingly interested in reconditioned electronics as the cost of smartphones, laptops, and a variety of other electronic products continues to soar.

                In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in demand for refurbished technology. In addition to the interruptions to the global supply chain, consumers have been persuaded to purchase refurbished technology due to pricing considerations, environmental concerns, and the availability of lifetime management services.

                In India, the market for reconditioned electronics is anticipated to grow from $5 billion in 2021 to $11 billion in 2026. E-commerce businesses have entered this mostly unorganised market as a result of the increase in the sale of reconditioned electronics. Additionally, organised sellers made up only 1 per cent of the market in 2016, but that percentage increased to 8 per cent in 2021 and is predicted to reach 20 per cent by 2026.

            <p class="active"><b>India plans new ‘right to repair’ rule for gadgets</b><br>According to a statement from the ministry of consumer affairs on Thursday, gadget manufacturers may soon have to mandatorily offer repair services for their products, from mobile phones to laptops, as a consumer right.
                Gadget manufacturers may soon have to mandatorily offer repair services for their products, from mobile phones to laptops, as a consumer right. The ministry of consumer affairs has set up a committee to come up with a comprehensive framework on a “right to repair”.
                The step could alter the landscape for tech maintenance, cutting costs for conked-out devices. Unlike car makers, mobile-phone companies often don’t provide original repair options, forcing consumers to entirely replace malfunctioning parts or make a new purchase. This could change.

                “Farming equipment, mobile phones/ tablets, consumer durables and automobiles/automobile equipment among sectors have been identified for the right to repair by the committee,” the ministry said in its statement.
                
                Consumer studies, such as a 2017 survey by Mostafa Sabbaghi of the University at Buffalo, have shown that when tech products falter, most consumers replace them with newer ones because fixing faulty devices reliably is difficult. Often, manufacturers don’t reveal full servicing information.
                
                In the US, for instance, President Joe Biden in 2021 had issued an executive order that “included a directive for limits on how tech manufacturers could restrict repairs”, according to a New York Times report.</p>

            <p class="active"><b>Apple to launch variety of new gadgets this fall, including iPhone 14</b><br>Apple is prepared to introduce a number of new gadgets between this fall and the start of 2023, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. According to The Verge, four iPhone 14 models, a group of new iPads, three Apple Watch models, multiple M2 and M3-updated Macs, updated AirPods Pro earbuds, a new HomePod, and an enhanced Apple TV are among the things Gurman refers to as a "deluge" of.

                Gurman anticipates finding the chip and its versions in a number of different devices, despite the fact that Apple only revealed two new Macs using its flagship M2 CPU at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this month. An M2 Mac mini, M2 Mac mini Pro, M2 Pro / M2 Max 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros, as well as an M2 Ultra / M2 Extreme Mac Pro, are all included.
                
                There's the long-rumoured mixed reality headgear from Apple, which is anticipated to include an M2 processor. If all of this wasn't overwhelming enough, Gurman claims that Apple's M3 chip is already under development and will probably be used in the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air notebooks that will be available in 2019.
                
                Apple will release the iPhone 14 this autumn, and Gurman's research provides a summary of all the speculations that have been circulating for the previous year or so. One is that, according to reports, the new and more potent A16 chip and support for always-on displays will only be available for the Pro and Pro Max variants.
                
                A 48-megapixel camera sensor, a new notch with a "pill-shaped cutout" for Face ID, and a hole-punch-style selfie camera are also expected to be included in the iPhone 14 Pro models. The 6.7-inch variant will replace the Mini model, according to Gurman, while the normal iPhone 14 will contain the A15 CPU found in the iPhone 13.
                
                According to Gurman's source, Apple will introduce 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models using M2 technology later this year, as well as a larger iPad between 14 and 15 inches in the "next year or two." Additionally, Gurman supports a previous rumour from 9to5Mac that claims a new entry-level iPad will feature an A14 CPU, 5G, and USB-C connectivity, as reported by The Verge.
                
                The basic Watch Series 8, a redesigned SE, and a more "rugged" watch aimed at users who participate in "extreme sports" are the other three new Apple Watch models that are anticipated for sale this fall.
                
                Gurman points out that although the S8 chip found in the forthcoming Watch Series 8 will provide performance comparable to that of the S7 and S6 chips, the Watch that will be released the following year is expected to have an updated processor. Gurman predicts that Apple will drop the Series 3 this fall in favour of the new SE, which might include the S8 CPU, an upgrade from the S5 chip found in the SE model from 2020.

            <p class="active"><b>Eight-year-old gadget geek turns innovator</b><br>The fourth-grade student of Hiranandani Upscale School finds his inspiration from his family. He says, “ My parents are my biggest support system. My mother helps me in buying all the required electronic equipment while my father guides me in my work. He also admires tech billionaire Elon Musk.
                His many projects include an automatic hand sanitiser dispenser, automatic street light, automatic dustbin, floor cleaner, cotton candy machine and portable fan cooler. His latest and “happiest accomplishment so far” is the obstacle detector that was created with the help of infrared sensor, buzzer, vibrating motor and battery.
                The device detects obstacles in front of the person and sends a signal to the buzzer and vibrating motor to beep and vibrate. With this, the person is alerted so that he can change the direction and escape the hurdle. His grandmother, who lacked clear eyesight, met with an accident and this made Aaryan think of a solution to the issue. Apart from research and generating ideas, the other challenge Aaryan was finalising the size of the battery and vibrating motors.
                It took him five days — three days of research and two days of electronic integration — to invent the device. He wishes to share it with medical institutions for free after further research and upgrades. Other than his passion for technology, he is also interested in football and swimming. He has even  authored two books — ‘Electronic Experiment for Kids’ and ‘Rocket in the Space’.Aaryan is also a TED-Ed speaker. He says “I showed the obstacle detector to my principal and she referred me to John Pradeep, who helped me get an opportunity to speak at the TED-Ed platform. I felt very happy and prepared to tell my story to the world.”
                He aims to work at NASA and ISRO or to start a company that launches rockets and create “the most futuristic rocket of all times”.

The smartphone appears to be less expensive than iPhones.

                Three different storage options will be available for the new smartphone. Rootmygalaxy lists the following combinations: 8GB RAM and 128GB, 8GB RAM and 256GB, and 12GB RAM and 256GB.Reports state that the prices will range from $397 (about Rs 31,000) to $456. (about Rs 36,000). The middle model is said to cost $419. (Rs 32,000).
                
                The pricing leak may be accurate given that the smartphone is said to be equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 778G+ processor, which is designed for smartphones costing between Rs 30,000 and Rs 60,000. The Motorola Edge 30 smartphone, which costs Rs 27,999 in India, now has this processor. However, the price of the iPhone 13 series in India is only half as much. The standard iPhone 13 now costs Rs 71,990 in India. It's possible that the Nothing Phone (1) will include two 50-megapixel rear cameras. Users should be able to record 4K movies at 60 frames per second.

                By October of this year, Apple intends to start producing its forthcoming iPhone 14 Series in India. Thus, Diwali could see the start of production. After two months since the device's introduction in China, the tech giant will reportedly begin manufacturing the most recent iPhones in India, according to Bloomberg.On September 14, the Apple iPhone 14 Series is anticipated to go on sale everywhere. The corporation may begin production in India after two months of its release, according to well-known analysts.
                
                Over the years, Apple has increased manufacture in India in cooperation with its suppliers. According to rumours, the business is working to reduce the customary six to nine-month manufacturing delay for the next iPhones. More than six months after the iPhone 13's unveiling, Apple began manufacturing the smartphone in India.
                
                In light of the conflicts between the US and the Chinese government, as well as other issues, Apple may begin selling the future iPhone 14 from India.

                A team at Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed a novel approach for comparing neural networks that looks within the "black box" of artificial intelligence to help researchers understand neural network behavior. Neural networks recognize patterns in datasets; they are used everywhere in society, in applications such as virtual assistants, facial recognition systems and self-driving cars.
                "The artificial intelligence research community doesn't necessarily have a complete understanding of what neural networks are doing; they give us good results, but we don't know how or why," said Haydn Jones, a researcher in the Advanced Research in Cyber Systems group at Los Alamos. "Our new method does a better job of comparing neural networks, which is a crucial step toward better understanding the mathematics behind AI."
                Jones is the lead author of the paper "If You've Trained One You've Trained Them All: Inter-Architecture Similarity Increases With Robustness," which was presented recently at the Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence. In addition to studying network similarity, the paper is a crucial step toward characterizing the behavior of robust neural networks

                Researchers at University College London (UCL) in the UK have created a novel x-ray technique for detecting explosives that might also be used to identify tumors.

               The potentially early-stage fatal tumors in humans could be noticed by the new x-ray method that collaborates with a deep-learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect explosives in luggages, according to a report published by MIT Technology Review on Friday.

                "The AI is exceptionally good at picking up these materials even when they're hidden inside other objects," said Sandro Olivo, study lead author from the UCL's Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering.
                "Even if we hide a small quantity of explosive somewhere because there will be a little bit of texture in the middle of many other things, the algorithm will find it."

                The technique could be used in medical applications, particularly cancer screening, according to the research team.
                
                Although the researchers have not yet tested whether the technique can successfully distinguish the texture of a tumor from surrounding healthy breast tissue, they are excited about the possibility of detecting very small tumors that would have previously gone undetected behind a patient's rib cage.
                
                "I'd love to do it one day," said Olivo. "If we get a similar hit rate in detecting texture in tumors, the potential for early diagnosis is huge."
