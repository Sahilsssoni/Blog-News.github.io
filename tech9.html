            <b>This website describes how Instagram and TikTok may track your info.</b><br>
            In New Delhi: A website has emerged that can explain how platforms like TikTok and Instagram may possibly see your personal data, including address, passwords, and credit card information, without your agreement as the debate over internet corporations and apps tracking your data intensifies.

            You can use a tool on the website InAppBrowser.com to find out which big social media sites are injecting "JavaScript code into third-party websites that present potential security and privacy problems to the user."
            InAppBrowser.com features a straightforward tool to "detail the JavaScript commands executed by the iOS app generating the page," claims the service's creator, Felix Krause.
            
            To use this tool for yourself, he advised, open the app you wish to analyse, share the url, hit the link to open the app, and then read the report displayed on the screen.
            
            Everybody can use InAppBrowser.com to independently confirm what apps are doing inside their in-app browsers.
            
            You can view the code used for this analysis on GitHub, as I have chosen to make it open source. This enables the community to gradually update and enhance this script, according to Krause's blog post.
