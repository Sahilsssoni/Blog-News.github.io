            <b>Some Exciting News Regarding The Newest Covid Variants
            </b><br>The incubation time, which is greater than that of the majority of viral infections, is the worst of Covid-19's most harmful characteristics. It can be more difficult to control a virus the longer it takes for it to replicate within a person before symptoms appear. This is because to the increased risk that those who are afflicted would unintentionally distribute it widely.

            The good news is that it seems like there is less time passing between exposure and the onset of symptoms.
            
            Scientists from Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing conducted experiments and research to estimate the incubation period of Covid induced by the various strains of SARS-CoV-2 by analysing data from more than 140 investigations. According to the findings, the average decreased from 5 days with the alpha version to 3.42 days with the omicron.
