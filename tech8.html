            <b>The forthcoming iPhone 14 will be produced by Apple in India.</b><br>
            By October of this year, Apple intends to start producing its forthcoming iPhone 14 Series in India. Thus, Diwali could see the start of production. After two months since the device's introduction in China, the tech giant will reportedly begin manufacturing the most recent iPhones in India, according to Bloomberg.On September 14, the Apple iPhone 14 Series is anticipated to go on sale everywhere. The corporation may begin production in India after two months of its release, according to well-known analysts.
            
            Over the years, Apple has increased manufacture in India in cooperation with its suppliers. According to rumours, the business is working to reduce the customary six to nine-month manufacturing delay for the next iPhones. More than six months after the iPhone 13's unveiling, Apple began manufacturing the smartphone in India.
            
            In light of the conflicts between the US and the Chinese government, as well as other issues, Apple may begin selling the future iPhone 14 from India.
