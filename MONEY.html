                India won the second game and the series after outplaying England by 50 runs in the first T20 International game. For the first time in the conflict's history, they now seek to completely humiliate England.

            <p class="active"><b>Virat Kohli is currently a liability: former cricketer from Pakistan</b><br>Virat Kohli has been referred to be a "liability" by Danish Kaneria, who has advised a younger player take his place. Recalling Kohli's struggles in the IPL, the former Pakistani cricketer said that he should have taken a break throughout the entire competition. Having cut Richard Gleeson on Saturday, Kohli's terrible run continued in both formats as Dawid Malan made a fantastic catch while sprinting from backward point, forcing Kohli to be out for just one. Even though India played well with both the bat and the ball, Kohli's performance is still a major concern, especially with less than four months till the World T20.

After the hosts were trounced by the Rohit Sharma-led team by 49 runs in the second T20I, the two teams will now face off in the third and final game on Sunday. After the match, MS Dhoni, a former captain of India, went to the Indian dressing room at Edgbaston and was spotted conversing with the starting batter, Ishan Kishan.

                Photos of Dhoni visiting the Indian dressing room were posted on the BCCI's official Twitter account, and the photos have since gone viral.
