            <b>Pakistan believes they can "compete against India day in and day out," according to Wasim Akram.
            </b><br>Wasim Akram asserts that Pakistan now believes "they can compete against India day in and day out" as a result of their victory against India in the 2021 T20 World Cup. He believes that a World Cup rivalry that was once one-sided has now become vibrant.

            During a press conference hosted by Star Sports, Akram stated that the Pakistani team has been improving over the previous several years. They have been reliable, and I believe that despite occurring at the World Cup a year ago, their victory over India gave them some confidence that they could compete with India every day. It was Pakistan's first victory over India when they defeated them by 10 wickets in the opening match of the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE.
