            <b>As a result of Daniil Medvedev's defeat against Nick Kyrgios in the Montreal event, Rafael Nadal received enormous benefit ahead of the US Open in 2022.</b><br>Following Daniil Medvedev's loss to Nick Kyrgios at the Montreal Masters on Thursday, Rafael Nadal has received a significant bonus ahead of the 2022 US Open. Since his victory against Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final earlier this month, Kyrgios has gone on an incredible winning streak that has helped Nadal climb back to the top of the ATP rankings in time for the forthcoming Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, Ohio. At the Montreal Masters, current world number one Medvedev was defending the championship he had won in 2021 by 1000 points. But as a result of his round of 16 loss to Kyrgios (7-6, 4-6, 2-6), the Russian stands to lose 990 points and experience a significant slide in the rankings.</p>
