Recalling Kohli's struggles in the IPL, the former Pakistani cricketer said that he should have taken a break throughout the entire competition. Having cut Richard Gleeson on Saturday, Kohli's terrible run continued in both formats as Dawid Malan made a fantastic catch while sprinting from backward point, forcing Kohli to be out for just one. Even though India played well with both the bat and the ball, Kohli's performance is still a major concern, especially with less than four months till the World T20.

After the hosts were trounced by the Rohit Sharma-led team by 49 runs in the second T20I, the two teams will now face off in the third and final game on Sunday. After the match, MS Dhoni, a former captain of India, went to the Indian dressing room at Edgbaston and was spotted conversing with the starting batter, Ishan Kishan.

                Photos of Dhoni visiting the Indian dressing room were posted on the BCCI's official Twitter account, and the photos have since gone viral.

Since his victory against Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final earlier this month, Kyrgios has gone on an incredible winning streak that has helped Nadal climb back to the top of the ATP rankings in time for the forthcoming Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, Ohio. At the Montreal Masters, current world number one Medvedev was defending the championship he had won in 2021 by 1000 points. But as a result of his round of 16 loss to Kyrgios (7-6, 4-6, 2-6), the Russian stands to lose 990 points and experience a significant slide in the rankings.</p>

            <p class="active"><b>Supreme Court claims that Praful Patel is attempting to sabotage the competition.</b><br>The Supreme Court declared on Monday that former Indian football chief Praful Patel was "trying to torpedo the tournament" after learning that the country would forfeit its right to host the Under-17 Women's World Cup as a result of FIFA's suspension of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The Under-17 Women's World Cup is set to take place in October.

                A clearly irritated Justice D Y Chandrachud, who presided over a two-judge bench hearing the move to dissolve the Committee of Administrators (CoA) overseeing the daily operations of AIFF, remarked, "You tell us there is an objection and you torpedo the competition. The event is being sabotaged by Mr. Praful Patel. You now give it a go. We'll take care of you.
                He was replying to a statement made by a lawyer for a state association that suggested that once the court decided to dissolve the CoA, one or two states would object to the selection of returning officers for the next elections to the Executive Council of AIFF.

            </b><br>Wasim Akram asserts that Pakistan now believes "they can compete against India day in and day out" as a result of their victory against India in the 2021 T20 World Cup. He believes that a World Cup rivalry that was once one-sided has now become vibrant.

            During a press conference hosted by Star Sports, Akram stated that the Pakistani team has been improving over the previous several years. They have been reliable, and I believe that despite occurring at the World Cup a year ago, their victory over India gave them some confidence that they could compete with India every day. It was Pakistan's first victory over India when they defeated them by 10 wickets in the opening match of the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE.

            The team now often includes Hooda, who made his international debut in February of this year.
