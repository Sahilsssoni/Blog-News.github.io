            <b>Supreme Court claims that Praful Patel is attempting to sabotage the competition.</b><br>The Supreme Court declared on Monday that former Indian football chief Praful Patel was "trying to torpedo the tournament" after learning that the country would forfeit its right to host the Under-17 Women's World Cup as a result of FIFA's suspension of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The Under-17 Women's World Cup is set to take place in October.

            A clearly irritated Justice D Y Chandrachud, who presided over a two-judge bench hearing the move to dissolve the Committee of Administrators (CoA) overseeing the daily operations of AIFF, remarked, "You tell us there is an objection and you torpedo the competition. The event is being sabotaged by Mr. Praful Patel. You now give it a go. We'll take care of you.
            He was replying to a statement made by a lawyer for a state association that suggested that once the court decided to dissolve the CoA, one or two states would object to the selection of returning officers for the next elections to the Executive Council of AIFF.
