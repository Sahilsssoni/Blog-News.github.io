            <b>Nothing about the price of the Phone 1 in India has been leaked! half of what an iPhone costs</b><br>Prior to its July 12 formal debut in India and other international markets, the Nothing Phone (1)'s price has been made public. The smartphone appears to be less expensive than iPhones.

            Three different storage options will be available for the new smartphone. Rootmygalaxy lists the following combinations: 8GB RAM and 128GB, 8GB RAM and 256GB, and 12GB RAM and 256GB.Reports state that the prices will range from $397 (about Rs 31,000) to $456. (about Rs 36,000). The middle model is said to cost $419. (Rs 32,000).
            
            The pricing leak may be accurate given that the smartphone is said to be equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 778G+ processor, which is designed for smartphones costing between Rs 30,000 and Rs 60,000. The Motorola Edge 30 smartphone, which costs Rs 27,999 in India, now has this processor. However, the price of the iPhone 13 series in India is only half as much. The standard iPhone 13 now costs Rs 71,990 in India. It's possible that the Nothing Phone (1) will include two 50-megapixel rear cameras. Users should be able to record 4K movies at 60 frames per second.
