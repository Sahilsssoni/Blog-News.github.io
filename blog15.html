            <b>Dominic Cork and Nasser Hussain are wrong. Deepti Sharma’s run out is within both the rules and spirit of cricket
            </b><br>A keeper warns the batter: “Next time you leave the crease while trying to play a shot, I will not hesitate to stump you out. I am leaving you with a warning this time.”

            The fielder standing in the slip cordon tells the batter, “Next time you cut the ball uppishly, I will take the catch and you’ll be walking back to the pavilion. I let you go this time.”
            
            The bowler tells the batter: “Next time you miss the line of the ball, I will not hesitate to appeal for lbw or bowled. You get a ‘life’ this time”.
            Similarly, a fielder can be seen warning the batter “not to play the ball in the air.” ‘I’ll catch the ball next time you play a false shot.”
            True. But if one were to agree with former English bowler Dominic Cork’s comments after Indian bowler Deepti Sharma “ran out” England’s non-striker Charlie Dean for backing up too far in the Lord’s ODI on Saturday, such a scenario can be expected in the future!

            Dominic Cork, speaking at the end of the match, said: “It was against the spirit of the game although it may be within the rules of the game. The bowler should have warned the non-striker before doing what she did to dismiss Dean.”     </p>
