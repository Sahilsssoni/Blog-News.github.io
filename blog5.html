            <b>India vs. England: A viral photo of MS Dhoni visiting the Indian dressing room in Edgbaston</b><br>With a commanding 2-0 lead against England in the upcoming three-match T20I series, Team India has performed at their very best. After the hosts were trounced by the Rohit Sharma-led team by 49 runs in the second T20I, the two teams will now face off in the third and final game on Sunday. After the match, MS Dhoni, a former captain of India, went to the Indian dressing room at Edgbaston and was spotted conversing with the starting batter, Ishan Kishan.

            Photos of Dhoni visiting the Indian dressing room were posted on the BCCI's official Twitter account, and the photos have since gone viral.
