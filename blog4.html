            <b>Virat Kohli is currently a liability: former cricketer from Pakistan</b><br>Virat Kohli has been referred to be a "liability" by Danish Kaneria, who has advised a younger player take his place. Recalling Kohli's struggles in the IPL, the former Pakistani cricketer said that he should have taken a break throughout the entire competition. Having cut Richard Gleeson on Saturday, Kohli's terrible run continued in both formats as Dawid Malan made a fantastic catch while sprinting from backward point, forcing Kohli to be out for just one. Even though India played well with both the bat and the ball, Kohli's performance is still a major concern, especially with less than four months till the World T20.
